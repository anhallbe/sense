# Sense
Middleware for sensor networks and ubiquitous computing

##What is this?
A piece of middleware that lets your toaster notify your phone about how your friend's shoes just realized that correlation sometimes imply causation. It's also a project for my Ubuquitous Computing class.

##Sense Server
A web server built with Node, Sails and ElasticSearch. The server API allows various sensors to publish and/or subscribe to data changes.

##jSense
A Java client library that lets the user send/receive sensor data in a decoupled way. The idea is that sensors/agents can be added to the system without (re-)configuring any of the existing components.
